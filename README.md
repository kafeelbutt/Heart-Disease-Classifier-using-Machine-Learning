# Heart-Disease-Classifier-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the dataset of heart disease and we have applied different ML algorithms to classify as the person has disease or not. By different using different visualization graphs I have checked in which age of the person the heart disease will occur and getting different insights from the data by plotting different graphs on the data.
